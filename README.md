# Get started with Terraform
A get started introduction to terraform


## Installation
I use OSX and AWS - so the natural way for me is to use homebrew. [Terraform get started guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/aws-get-started)
lets me easily chose what to do.

```
# Tap into hashicorp
brew tap hashicorp/tap

# Now install terraform
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform

# And update to latest
brew upgrade hashicorp/tap/terraform
```
